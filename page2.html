                 <h2>You can pick your hero, but not your enemy</h2>
                    <p>This section is going to talk about how to not choose the dumbest F-ing character of your god damn life. Hero’s in siege are typically called operators but honestly they are a hero in my eyes. There aint no way you can talk a shot gun to the chest and live and not call yourself a hero.</p>

                    <div class="col">
                        <h3>Choosing the right person</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li>The First step to any game with hard team based play is learning the operators. Some you need to know thy enemy before you know thy win. If you don't know what you're up against than there is no way to take into account abilities and cooldowns. </li>

                                <li>Second, Learning counter picks. Not all games have the abilities to eliminate or change character mid game, but the ones that do you can get royally messed up by someone once they know how to counter you. learn your counter picks and how to effetely use and defend against them. This will take some practice but if you didn't already have time you wouldn’t be on here, wouldya punk?</li>

                                <li> Do not worry about a main at the start of a knew game. Most people stick to one character and insist that it doesn't matter who they play because they're unbeatable with this one character. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Every character in every game has a counter pick, and if your enemy has any sense they're gonna see that you have a stupid main and pick against it. Then you're useless. You can have a favorite that you're good with but insisting on a main is insisting on getting hit with a fist full of failure.</li>

                                <li> If you're not doing so well in that match, change what you're doing. Do not take a character in a competitive match that you can't use well. ALL GAMES HAVE QUICK PLAY. Learn the mechanics before you get blapped and reported for being bad at the game.</li>

                                <li> Lastly learn the guns. each operator usually has diffrent guns within year one and year two, each varies in recoil damage and fire rate, just becuase you were good with Bucks DMR does not mean that you're going to be good with BlakBeards</li>

                            </ol>
