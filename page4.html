                    <p>Learn you weapons fast mah dude. This section is about handleing your gun and not floping like a god damn idiot. This guide is meant to fix your potato aim.</p>

                        <h3>Gun handling</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li> Nothing gives you the tinglies more than watching someone who’s ridiculously good at the game sauce three enemies with headshots, but how do they do it? Well, with supurior skill and a wifi faster than Usain Bolt.</li>

                                <li>Every gun is different as talked about before so obviously step one is actually using the gun, finding out the recoil and compensating. DMR's are used for precision kills from a distance, sub machine guns are used for up close and personal spraying with low damage, and Assault rifles are medium range medium blappage. Everyone should start with an AR because their the easiest to use and require little knowledge of the map and not as much accuracy.</li>

                                <li> Next is reloading and aiming down sights, remember your enemy can hear when you aim down your sighs and when you reload so make sure that you don’t switch between too frequently in gun fights, what you want to do is make the enemy loose his clip and reload. If you're being a high speed character like Bandito Burrito or his brother Baeger than you can rush forward with an M80 Shot gun or even a zesty knife. </li>

                                <li> Next if you find yourself out of ammo quicker than your combatant than I have one tip, Git Gud BOI. Take out your pistol you noob, a bullet to the face in Rainbow Six is an insta kill, if you sharpen your aim it doesn’t matter what you're using you can sauce the entire enemy team with a pea shooter.</li>

                                <li> Lastly, get out there and lay down the sauce. Remember that you can do it. But only with the sauce, juice comes and goes but sauce, that S!@T stays in the fridge forever.</li>
