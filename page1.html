                <h2>Communicate before its Communi-late</h2>
                    <p>Our goal is to help noobs in Rainbow Six Siege get over that sucky phase quicker, helping you talk to your team and make it so that way you gain some social skills instead of gaining weight.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="wrapper">
                    <div class="col">
                        <h3>Communicating with your team</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li>The First thing you want to do is establish the desire to talk to your team. For some reason people are either openly annoying or mute. Being the first to talk breaks the ice and lets people know that you're ready to smack the enemy team like a half empty ketchup bottle.  </li>

                                <li> If you're trying to get that god tier Ace that'll make your inbox spam with friend requests and angry messages from the losers on the other side of the kill feed, then announce everything. Sure, you might get muted by some people but letting your team know where you're going or where the enemy is the basic requirements for a good composition. If you have a dedicated team than you probably don't need to do this as much, but this is for noobs not no lives. </li>

                                <li>Next is to be persistent with this, if you're team isn't replying then speak for good will. Odds are they can hear you they just don't have their headphones in, it could still save someone from getting blapped by moving down the wrong corridor.</li>
                                
                                <li> Also tell you team when you're going to be peaking the cornor, let them make some noises to distract the enemy before they just see you quietly sneaking up on them. Their is some lag time in Rainbow six and in most other games so it'll be a good tip to tell them what you're doing.</li>

                                <li>Lastly be responsible, do not, I repeat, DO NOT be the guy who goes into the voice coms and starts blaming his team mates for the lose even though they are at the bottom of the team. If you do this, I can sincerely say form everyone to you, uninstall. </li>
