                <h2>Be The Kool Aid Man</h2>
                    <p>You are going to burst through a wall faster than the god damn kool aid man. These walls dont pay no bills so its your time to evict them. This section covers going over breakable surfaces and how to properly breach and manipulate them.</p>

                    <h3>Practicing</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li> The first thing you want to do in a map is learn the s!%t, if you don't know where  you're going in rainbow six you're going to get flanked and you're going to be mad, end of story. Unlike most other shooter games rainbow six has some unique map mechanics that take a very long time to get use to so be prepared to grind for a couple days to learn those tight corners.</li>

                            <li> Second, walls, you need to learn that you're going to be the god damn Kool-Aid man sometimes because most walls in Rainbow Six are breakable and in fact some characters specialize in taking these walls down. The walls that can be taken down are mostly made of wood or plaster so get use to people opening them up. you can also shoot through them so if you're defending make sure to make a cheeky peek hole. Peek holes are tiny holes made by shooting, punching or even impact grenades to help see or move through objectives.></li>

                            <li> Floors and hatches will make you wanna rip your lookin holes out. I hate the fact that an enemy can look through the floor and dome you faster than el chapo escapes from prison. On defending make sure you cover the hatches before the round starts, less you're a three speed character and roaming, than keep them open to make a quick escape. Roaming is when you walk around outside of the objective to surprise an enemy braking in. </li>

                            <li> Lastly Just lay down the sauce. Nothing makes a match more spicy than that nice burning sensation you leave the enemy team with when you hit them with the sauce. </li>
